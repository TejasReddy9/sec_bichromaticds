# Overview
In this project we have implemented of an example of Bichromatic data structures i.e, smallest enclosed circle problem. A large set of points which can take any of the two types of colours is given and as a result we would form a circle which covers maximum number of points of the same colour in the same plane. 

## Requirements
The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library ([CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/download.html)).
